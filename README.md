# 🧵 Thndr Clothing

**Hey Everyone!** Welcome to this repository. Thndr Clothing is my take on building a fully functional clothing e-commerce site from scratch using React. Coming from a web-dev background, I wanted to create something that feels like a real shopping experience while practicing end-to-end integration of core e-commerce features.

---

**Thndr Clothing** goes beyond just displaying products – it simulates the entire customer journey: authentication, browsing products, adding items to the cart, and even test payments! The site is designed to be responsive, clean, and easy to navigate, making it feel like a modern fashion storefront.
